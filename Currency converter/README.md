# Currency Converter (Tkinter)

Improved version of the basic converter app provided in class.

## What I Changed
- Added input validation (no crashes on empty/incorrect values).
- Formatted all numbers to 2 decimals for clean currency output.
- Added Enter-key support and better default values.
- Improved Swap logic (safe, rounded, and error-free).
- Cleaned layout and centered the window.
- Improved code style: snake_case, comments, grouped logic.

## What Works Better Now
- App no longer crashes on wrong input.
- Swapping twice returns the original value (round-trip test).
- Zero/negative rates are blocked.
- Keyboard-only operation works smoothly.

## Main Takeaway
Small fixes in validation, formatting, and usability make a simple app feel much more polished and reliable.
