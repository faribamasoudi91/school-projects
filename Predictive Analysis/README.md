# Predictive Analysis Project

This folder contains my predictive analysis assignment based on the dataset used in:

Bauhr, Monika; Czibik, Ágnes; Fazekas, Mihály; de Fine Licht, Jenny (2020).
"Lights in the Shadows of Public Procurement."
Harvard Dataverse.

## About the Project
The goal of the project was to use machine learning models (OLS, LASSO, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
to predict corruption risk in public procurement using transparency indicators.

## Files Included
- Project report (PDF)
- Code files-Python 
- Figures and plots


## Data Source
The **raw dataset is NOT uploaded** because:
- It is too large for GitHub

You can download the original dataset here:
